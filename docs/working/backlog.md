## Phase 32 — v0.4.0 Proactive Assistance

> **Status:** ACTIVE — 10 tasks (P32-T01–P32-T10). v0.4.0 feature phase; scope reframed 2026-06-24 to a focused Proactive Assistance release (toolkit/recipe/apply moved to v0.5.0 — see `v0.5.0_contract.md`).

### P32 Notes
- v0.4.0 scope: grain suggest, phase close archiving, archive show, workflow next integration, grain notes full, workflow metrics, Pulse telemetry foundation, GitHub feedback (report + publish), docs hygiene
- T01 (spec) is satisfied by the canonical `docs/canonical/suggest_spec.md` → **done**
- T02 (implement) and T05 (workflow next integration) build on the locked spec
- T03, T06, T07, T08, T10 are independent and can run in parallel
- T09 depends on T06 (grain notes full implementation)
- T10 (docs hygiene) is founder-requested; fixes current_focus drift + adds an audit check
- Phase 31 is fully closed; no DX blockers remain

### P32-T01 — Write `grain suggest` spec
- **Status:** done (satisfied by canonical `docs/canonical/suggest_spec.md`)
- **Description:** Define the `grain suggest` command contract. Inputs: workspace state (open questions, doc gaps, backlog shape, recent closures). Outputs: ranked candidate tasks with draft context and plan seeds. Human approval gate: `grain suggest --accept <id>` promotes to a real packet; `grain suggest --prune` clears stale suggestions. Spec should cover output format, storage location, approval flow, and integration with `grain workflow next`.
- **Files:** `docs/working/suggest_spec.md` (new)
- **Model:** frontier_model
- **Dependencies:** none

### P32-T02 — Implement `grain suggest`
- **Status:** done
- **Description:** Implement `grain suggest` from the spec. Core logic: read workspace state, score candidate task types, generate ranked suggestions with draft context/plan seeds, write to `.grain/suggestions.json`. `grain suggest --accept <id>` creates a packet from the suggestion. `grain suggest --prune` clears stale entries. `--format json` output.
- **Files:** `src/grain/services/suggest_service.py` (new), `src/grain/cli/suggest.py` (new), tests
- **Model:** frontier_model
- **Dependencies:** P32-T01

### P32-T03 — Extend `grain phase close` to auto-archive task packets
- **Status:** done
- **Description:** When a phase is closed, automatically move all `tasks/P{N}-*` packet directories to `tasks/archive/phase-{N}/` alongside the existing doc snapshot. Behavior: (1) detect all packet dirs matching the phase prefix in `tasks/`; (2) create `tasks/archive/phase-{N}/` if absent; (3) move packets; (4) update `docs/archive/phases/phase-{N}/metadata.json` with `tasks_done` count and `tasks_archive` path. Add `--keep-tasks` flag to skip the move when a packet is being carried forward to the next phase.
- **Files:** `src/grain/services/phase_service.py`, `src/grain/services/archive_service.py`, `src/grain/cli/phase.py`, tests
- **Model:** frontier_model
- **Dependencies:** none

### P32-T04 — Extend `grain archive show` to surface packet list from task archive
- **Status:** done
- **Description:** `grain archive show --phase N` currently shows doc snapshot content. Extend it to also list the task packets in `tasks/archive/phase-{N}/` from the `tasks_archive` field in `metadata.json`. Output: phase metadata, doc snapshot files present, packet list with task ID and title (read from `task.md`). `--format json` output. If no task archive exists for a phase (pre-v0.4.0 close), surface the metadata note gracefully.
- **Files:** `src/grain/cli/archive.py`, `src/grain/services/archive_service.py`, tests
- **Model:** frontier_model
- **Dependencies:** none

### P32-T05 — Integrate `grain suggest` into `grain workflow next`
- **Status:** done
- **Description:** When `grain workflow next` evaluates the workspace and finds no obvious next task (e.g. `stop_reason: no_ready_tasks` or `backlog_empty`), automatically run the suggest engine and surface the top candidate in the workflow next output. Text output: inline suggestion block. JSON output: `suggestion` field with candidate. Does not write anything — suggestion is surface-only until `grain suggest --accept <id>` is called.
- **Files:** `src/grain/services/workflow_service.py`, `src/grain/services/suggest_service.py`, tests
- **Model:** frontier_model
- **Dependencies:** P32-T01, P32-T02

### P32-T06 — `grain notes` full implementation
- **Status:** done
- **Description:** Graduate `grain notes` from write-only stub to a queryable, actionable friction inbox. (1) Structured rows in `tooling_notes.md` with `id`, `type`, `status`, `created_at`, `body`; (2) `grain notes list` with `--type` and `--status` filters and `--format json`; (3) `grain notes show <id>` — full note detail; (4) `grain notes resolve <id>` — mark addressed with optional resolution note; (5) open notes with type `bug` or `friction` surface as `low`-severity findings in `grain docs audit`; (6) `grain notes add` improvements — auto-assign incremental ID, timestamp, default status `open`.
- **Files:** `src/grain/services/notes_service.py` (new), `src/grain/cli/notes.py` (extend), `src/grain/services/docs_audit_service.py` (extend), tests
- **Model:** frontier_model
- **Dependencies:** none

### P32-T07 — Workflow metrics — `grain metrics` command
- **Status:** done
- **Description:** Implement `grain metrics` for per-phase velocity and cost tracking. Reads task archive and docs archive to compute: (1) phase duration (open → close dates from metadata); (2) task count per phase; (3) stop-reason frequency from `.grain/last_workflow_state.json` history; (4) `grain metrics --phase N` for single-phase detail; (5) `grain metrics export` dumps full history as JSON. Writes `.grain/metrics_cache.json` with a 1-hour TTL. `--format json` output on all subcommands.
- **Files:** `src/grain/services/metrics_service.py` (new), `src/grain/cli/metrics.py` (new), tests
- **Model:** frontier_model
- **Dependencies:** none

### P32-T08 — Pulse telemetry foundation — opt-in event emission contract
- **Status:** done
- **Description:** Lay the Grain-side event emission contract for Pulse (the planned Diwata-wide telemetry layer). (1) Define a `TelemetryEvent` dataclass with `event_type`, `version`, `timestamp`, `payload` fields; (2) implement `telemetry_service.py` with a `emit(event)` method — fire-and-forget, never raises, logs to `.grain/telemetry_queue.jsonl` when endpoint is unreachable; (3) instrument key workflow moments: phase close, task close, `grain suggest --accept`, stop reason on `grain workflow next`; (4) opt-in via `telemetry.enabled: true` in `docs_manifest.yaml` or `GRAIN_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` env var; (5) no telemetry emitted unless explicitly enabled — default is off. Transport and aggregation are Pulse's responsibility; Grain only emits.
- **Files:** `src/grain/services/telemetry_service.py` (new), `src/grain/domain/telemetry.py` (new), instrumentation in phase/task/workflow/suggest services, tests
- **Model:** frontier_model
- **Dependencies:** none

### P32-T09 — `grain notes publish` — GitHub issue submission from CLI
- **Status:** done
- **Description:** Extend `grain notes` with a `publish` subcommand that submits a note directly to GitHub Issues. (1) `grain notes publish <id>` — formats the note as a GitHub issue (title from note body first line, body from full note + metadata); (2) applies appropriate label from note type (`bug` → `bug`, `friction`/`feature` → `enhancement`); (3) GitHub repo configurable in `docs_manifest.yaml` under `github.repo`; (4) token via `GRAIN_GITHUB_TOKEN` env var — never stored in workspace files; (5) prints the created issue URL on success; (6) `grain issue create --title "..." --type bug|feature|friction` as a standalone path that skips the notes log and goes straight to GitHub.
- **Files:** `src/grain/services/github_service.py` (new), `src/grain/cli/notes.py` (extend), `src/grain/cli/report.py` (new), `src/grain/cli/issue.py` (new), tests
- **Model:** frontier_model
- **Dependencies:** P32-T06
- **Note:** implements BOTH the canonical URL-based `grain report` (no token, browser-confirmed, upstream) and the API-based `grain notes publish` (token, headless, files into the user's own repo — the path a familiar/agent can drive without a browser).

### P32-T10 — Docs hygiene — phase_status_consistency audit check + current_focus rewrite
- **Status:** done
- **Description:** Founder-requested hygiene. (1) Rewrite `docs/working/current_focus.md` from 377 lines of self-contradicting per-phase prose to a single Current Phase block + Closed-Phase Ledger; (2) add a `phase_status_consistency` check to `grain docs audit` (error severity) that fires when a phase is described as both active and closed, or when the Current Phase appears in the closed ledger; (3) document the check in `docs_audit_spec.md`.
- **Files:** `src/grain/services/docs_audit_service.py` (extend), `docs/working/current_focus.md` (rewrite), `docs/working/docs_audit_spec.md` (extend), tests
- **Model:** frontier_model
- **Dependencies:** none

## Phase 33 — v0.5.0 Planning

> **Status:** ACTIVE (planning) — no execution tasks yet. v0.5.0 scope lives in `docs/working/v0.5.0_contract.md` (DRAFT); this phase locks it into execution phases + packets in a dedicated planning pass, the way Phase 30 planned v0.4.0.

### P33 Notes
- Candidate v0.5.0 deliverables: general-purpose / non-code workspaces, `grain recipe` execution + `recipe suggest`, external signal ingestion, safe apply graduation, Grain-as-engine contract, toolkit contract, dev/runtime alignment, context token-budget proxy, graduated-ceremony / quick lane, package self-update (humans + familiars)
- Locked specs already exist for several: `recipe_spec.md`, `toolkit_contract.md`, `workspace_model.md`, `apply_graduation.md`, `feedback_spec.md`
- Do not start execution until v0.4.0 is released (`pnpm trace release minor`) and the suggest/feedback foundation is stable

---

## Phase 34 — v0.5.0 Recipe Engine (Step-Runner) MVP

> **Status:** ACTIVE (drafted) — 9 packets (P34-T01–P34-T09). First v0.5.0 execution phase: ships the operator-mode recipe step-runner (parser → persistence → engine → CLI → bundled recipe → demo → tests) per `recipe_spec.md` §7 MVP. Critical path is T01–T08 (target July 21); T09 is STRETCH.

### P34 Notes
- Scope is the §7 MVP only: `grain.recipe/v2` parser, file-backed `RecipeRun` (`grain.recipe-run/v1`) under `docs/recipes/runs/<run-id>/`, operator-mode engine, CLI surface, one bundled 6-step research-brief recipe, a pre-staged demo workspace + runbook, and integration tests. Parallel-engine isolation: no `evaluate_workflow_state` / packet-lifecycle coupling.
- **Build order:** T01 → T02 → T03 → T04 → T05 → T06 → T07 → T08; T09 is STRETCH (off the July-21 critical path). The strict numeric dependency graph is acyclic with this topological order.
- **Spec decisions (resolved 2026-06-28):** `supervision` is parsed into `RecipeDefinition` and carried into `run.json`; `start_run` returns outcome `started` (status `pending`, no auto-advance); per-step `gate` is persisted in `run.json`; the service module is `recipe_service.py`; `run.json` separates `mode` (operator|auto) from `supervision` (supervised|gated|autonomous); operator mode pauses at the new `awaiting_input` status — a bare `recipe run` does not auto-complete offline. See `recipe_engine_spec.md` §2.2 / §3.1 / §5.
- **T04↔T06 cycle: resolved** — T04's `recipe list` test uses a scaffolded fixture (not the bundled recipe), recipe enumeration is owned by T03, and T06 depends on T04. Cross-reference labels (T06→T04, T07 dep roles, T08 resume attribution) corrected.
- **Demo approach (locked):** "reference run + live `next`" — show the committed `research-brief-0001` run, then drive `grain recipe next` / `status` live; auto-mode (`--auto`) pre-recorded is the optional "watch artifacts appear" beat.

### P34-T01 — v2 recipe parser + typed dataclasses
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** Parse `grain.recipe/v2` definitions into typed dataclasses (`RecipeDefinition`, `RecipeParam`, steps) with strict-key rejection; validate `category` against `VALID_CATEGORIES`; `supervision` is accept-and-ignore (deferred run-mode), and error messages name the offending key/version.
- **Dependencies:** none

### P34-T02 — File-backed RecipeRun persistence + create_run
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** File-backed `RecipeRun`/`RecipeStepRecord` model (`grain.recipe-run/v1`) with `create_run(...)` and the run-id allocation helper, persisting atomically (step artifact → `run.json`) under `docs/recipes/runs/<run-id>/` for lossless round-trip.
- **Dependencies:** P34-T01

### P34-T03 — Operator-mode recipe engine
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** Operator-mode engine — `resolve` / `start_run` / `next` / `resume` over declared-inputs-only `{{steps.<id>}}` token scoping, with `NextResult` outcomes and typed errors; renders prompts and surfaces output paths, never generating step content.
- **Dependencies:** P34-T01, P34-T02

### P34-T04 — CLI: grain recipe list / show / scaffold
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** `grain recipe list | show | scaffold` over the shared discovery service (bundled + workspace enumeration), with text and `--format json` output; creates and registers the `recipe` Click group.
- **Dependencies:** P34-T01, P34-T03

### P34-T05 — CLI: grain recipe run / next / status / resume / gate
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** Extend the `recipe` Click group with `run | next | status | resume | gate` over the engine, driving operator-mode runs step-by-step and exposing gate approve/reject and resume-on-failure.
- **Dependencies:** P34-T03, P34-T04

### P34-T06 — Bundled research-brief recipe
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** Ship the canonical 6-step, gateless `research-brief` recipe as package data and wire the bundled-recipe discovery enumeration so `grain recipe list/show` (T04) surface it as `source: bundled`.
- **Dependencies:** P34-T01, P34-T03, P34-T04

### P34-T07 — Pre-staged recipe-demo workspace + runbook
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** Pre-staged `examples/recipe-demo/` workspace (a byte-identical copy of the bundled research-brief plus a completed `run.json`) and a shippable runbook for the venue/PyPI demo path, using a valid `supervision` level.
- **Dependencies:** P34-T05, P34-T06

### P34-T08 — Recipe MVP integration / e2e tests
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** Integration/e2e tests over the bundled recipe: operator run-to-`done` (gateless, no API key) and resume-on-failure (engine T03 / CLI T05), discovering the recipe via the engine.
- **Dependencies:** P34-T05, P34-T06

### P34-T09 — Agent auto-mode orchestrator (STRETCH)
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** Auto-mode orchestrator — `resolve_recipe_agent` + a single canonical `workflow_loop.yaml` driving autonomous/gated recipe runs (halting on the gated step) on top of the operator engine; STRETCH, off the July-21 critical path.
- **Dependencies:** P34-T03, P34-T05

## Phase 35 — v0.5.0 Grain-as-Engine Headless Contract

> **Status:** ACTIVE (drafted) — 11 packets (P35-T01–P35-T11). Ships the headless engine contract: `grain.engine/v1` envelope + typed error model, single version resolver, capability registry, envelope/error wiring across CLI + MCP surfaces, and a CLI↔MCP conformance suite. Foundation T01–T03 land first; per `engine_contract_spec.md` §8. The 11 packets map 1:1 onto the §8 MVP areas.

### P35 Notes
- **Build order:** foundation T01 / T02 / T03 (no deps, parallelizable) → T04, T05 (consume T01) → T06 (consumes T01/T02/T03/T05) → T07, T08 → T09, T10 → T11 (capstone, consumes T01–T10). The declared graph is acyclic with this topological order.
- **Scope is §8 MVP only:** envelope + errors, version resolver, capability registry, envelope wiring (workflow `next`/`run`/`loop`/`explain` + recipe sites), recipe error mapping, MCP surface expansion, HTTP wrapper fix, capabilities/workspace CLI, non-interactive gate envelopes, version check, and conformance tests. **Deferred per §8:** `workflow guard`/`reconcile` and the remaining legacy JSON sites (task*/review*/suggest*/docs audit/status) stay bare-by-default behind `--envelope`/`GRAIN_ENGINE_ENVELOPE=1`.
- **Cross-packet items to resolve before building (see verify report):** (1) `version_check` ownership across T03 (capability seed) / T06 (MCP tool) / T10 (CLI + service) — T10 must consume, not re-add; (2) pin the T03 seed `surfaces` values so T06's `tools/list` derivation is deterministic; (3) have T01 enumerate the `suggest accept` / `docs audit` kinds in `VALID_ENGINE_KINDS` so T09 does not hit its escalation/blocker path; (4) state that T09's new suggest/docs emits are always-enveloped to reconcile with T04's default-bare legacy sites.

### P35-T01 — grain.engine/v1 envelope + typed error model
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** Define the `grain.engine/v1` `EngineEnvelope` and `ErrorEnvelope` dataclasses (§4.2), `VALID_ENGINE_KINDS`/`VALID_ERROR_CODES`, and the error taxonomy (`code`/`exit_code` as ClassVars on `ForgeError` subclasses) plus a format-aware `error_handler`; `errors.py` and `envelope.py` resolve one-way (acyclic) and an `envelope_to_dict` serializes the error object.
- **Dependencies:** none

### P35-T02 — single version resolver (src/grain/version.py)
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** Introduce one `get_version()` resolver in `src/grain/version.py` (via `importlib.metadata`) and rewire reported-version sites (MCP `serverInfo.version`, etc.) to it, removing scattered `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH(-dev)` string literals as reported versions.
- **Dependencies:** none

### P35-T03 — capability registry (Capability dataclass + CAPABILITIES seed)
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** Frozen `Capability` dataclass with `__post_init__`/`VALID_*` validation and the `CAPABILITIES` seed (§6.2) carrying `since`/`kind`/`drive`/`stability`/`surfaces`; pins the §6.2 ids and the genuinely-frozen kind/drive/stability subset, including per-entry `surfaces ∈ {cli, mcp}`.
- **Dependencies:** none

### P35-T04 — envelope + error wiring across CLI emit sites
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** Route `workflow next`/`run`/`loop`/`explain` and the recipe CLI sites through a single `emit(...)` helper that frames the `grain.engine/v1` envelope (built inline per T01's note) with `grain_version` from the version resolver, behind the `--envelope`/`GRAIN_ENGINE_ENVELOPE=1` opt-in; `guard`/`reconcile` are deferred per §8.
- **Dependencies:** P35-T01, P35-T02

### P35-T05 — engine_error_to_forge mapping for recipe engine
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** Extract `engine_error_to_forge(exc) -> ForgeError` mapping recipe engine errors (§4.3 table) and collapse `_drive` to catch both `RecipeEngineError` and `RecipeSchemaError` (a `ValueError`, not a `RecipeEngineError`), preserving today's exit codes (e.g. `RecipeSchemaError` → exit 3) with no behavior change.
- **Dependencies:** P35-T01

### P35-T06 — MCP surface expansion (catalog-driven tools/list)
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** Expand `mcp_service.py` to a single capability-derived catalog — `tools/list` filtered by `surfaces ∈ mcp`, `_ok`/`_err` envelope helpers, and the extended `McpTool` (write/capability) — with every catalog tool delegating to the CLI-canonical service fn and returning a `grain.engine/v1` envelope; defers the `version_check` tool to T10.
- **Dependencies:** P35-T01, P35-T02, P35-T03, P35-T05

### P35-T07 — HTTP MCP wrapper alignment (apps/grain-mcp/main.py)
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** Align the HTTP wrapper app (`apps/grain-mcp/main.py`, at monorepo root) so `tools/list` derives from the expanded registry and JSON-RPC boundary errors map to the §4 error shape (§5.6); resolve the cross-package path/test-runner/REUSE-header questions before editing.
- **Dependencies:** P35-T01, P35-T02, P35-T06

### P35-T08 — CLI: grain capabilities / workspace
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** `grain capabilities list|show` and `grain workspace list` commands emitting `grain.engine/v1` envelopes (status `ok`/`error`) over the capability registry; consumes the envelope/error taxonomy (T01), version resolver (T02), and `CAPABILITIES` (T03).
- **Dependencies:** P35-T01, P35-T02, P35-T03

### P35-T09 — non-interactive gate/ok envelopes (suggest accept, docs audit)
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** Emit `grain.engine/v1` envelopes on the consent path for `suggest accept` and `docs audit` (§7.1) — `status:gate` on the gate, `status:ok` on `--yes` — always-enveloped on these legacy sites regardless of the default-bare opt-out; depends on T01 having registered their kinds.
- **Dependencies:** P35-T01, P35-T04

### P35-T10 — version check (grain version --check/--refresh + version_check tool)
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** `grain version` with `--check`/`--refresh` plus a shared `version_service` producing the `grain.version/v1` payload (installed/latest/update_available via the pypi adapter, §7.2) that both the CLI and the MCP `version_check` read tool delegate to; consumes (not re-adds) the T03 capability seed and T06 MCP helpers.

### P35-T11 — change proposal + CLI↔MCP conformance tests
- **Status:** draft
- **Description:** Capstone: the canonical-doc change proposal plus the conformance suite — taxonomy error round-trip and CLI↔MCP frame parity over an always-enveloped command pair (e.g. CLI `capabilities` ↔ MCP `capabilities_list`, or CLI `version` ↔ MCP `version_check`), not the default-bare legacy `workflow`/`recipe` sites.

## Backlog Maintenance Rules

1. Backlog items must remain concrete and implementable
2. Backlog items should map to one or more future task packets
3. Large backlog items may be split before execution
4. Backlog items must not redefine canonical rules
5. Closed phases are collapsed to a stub entry — verbose task descriptions live in the task archive
